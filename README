This directory contains Genome Scale Metabolic Models of Methanotrophyc organisms.
Each model is available in SBML format, together with two tab separated files containing lists of reactions and metabolites.
The list of reactions includes their ids, names, stoichiometry and gene associations, the list of metabolites contains ids and names.
Gene annotations from RAST are contained in excel files.

A python script that generates tab separated lists of reactions and metabolites from SBML models is included (makelists.py)
Running it requires the previous instalation of COBRApy.

The models currently available are for the methanotrophs:

Methylocystis hirsuta
Methylocystis sp. SC2
Methylocystis sp. SB2
