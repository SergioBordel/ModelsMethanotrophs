This directory contains Genome Scale Metabolic Models of Methanotrophyc organisms.
Each model is available in SBML format, together with two tab separated files containing lists of reactions and metabolites.
The list of reactions includes their ids, names, stoichiometry and gene associations, the list of metabolites contains ids and names.
Gene annotations from RAST are contained in excel files.

The models currently available are for the methanotrophs:

Methylocystis hirsuta
Methylocystis sp. SC2
Methylocystis sp. SB2
